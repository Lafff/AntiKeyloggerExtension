This extension has two modes of operation. 
1 - Input encryption mode (when the input key field is empty, otherwise the user's key is used)
2 - Modified keyboard mode

Changing input characters is based on intercepting input characters through the event mechanism, processing the entered character through the appropriate algorithms,
and entering the resulting character through field properties.
